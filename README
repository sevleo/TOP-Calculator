there are 3 empty vars: left operand, operator, right operand

if left operand is empty and user clicks on a number or the decimal point button:
    add the number to the left operand
    show the number on the screen
    if the user clicks on the decimal point button, add "0."

if left operand is not empty and user clicks on a number or the decimal point button:
    add the number as the next digit to the left operand
    update the number on the screen
    if first digit was "0" and this character is not a decimal point, override "0".

when the user clicks an operator button
    add the operator next to the left operand
    show the operator on the screen
    if the user clicks on another operator button before enterign the right operand, override the operator and update the screen

when the user clicks on a number or the decimal point after clicking an operand:
    add the number to the right operand
    show the number on the screen next to the operand
    if the user clicks on the decimal point button, add "0."

if the right operand is not empty and user clicks on a number or the decimal point button:
    add the number as the next digit to the right operand
    update the number on the screen
    if first digit was "0" and this character is not a decimal point, override "0".

if all three vars are populated and the user clicks "=":
    perform the operation respective to the operand
    show the result on the screen
    store the result in the left operand value
    erase operator and right operand

if all three vars are populated and the user clicks an operator button:
    perform the operation respective to the operand
    shwo the result on the screen
    store the result in the left operand value
    erase the operator and the right operand
    add the operand




button clickability rules
    if left operand is empty, do not allow to click on an operator button
    if there is already a decimal point, do not allow to click the decimal point button
    the equal button will be availble only after left operand, operator, and right operand are in place.
